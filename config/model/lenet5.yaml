# LeNet5 Model Configuration

name: "lenet5"

# Model architecture
architecture:
  in_channels: 3  # 3 channels (grayscale replicated to RGB)
  num_classes: 1  # Binary classification (single output neuron)

# Note: Grayscale images (1 channel) are replicated to 3 channels
# during training to match LeNet5 input expectation
# Dataset outputs [B, 1, 32, 32] -> Training replicates to [B, 3, 32, 32]

# Pretrained weights (optional)
pretrained: null  # Path to .pth file or null
